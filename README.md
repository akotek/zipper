* Implementation of singly-linked-list in Clojure.

* Implementation of Zipper datastrcture to improve some O(n) operations (to O(1)) which are lacking in functional single-linked-list or able in doubly-linked-list (end-to-start traversal, insertion before/after given node, removal of a given node and more).
