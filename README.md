* Implementation of singly-linked-list in Clojure.

* Implementation of Zipper datastrcture to improve some O(n) operations (to O(1)) which are lacking in functional single-linked-list but able in doubly-linked-list (end-to-start traversal, insertion before/after given node, removal of a given node and more). As doubly-linked-list is difficult to implement in a functional-style, we'll use the zipper-way.
